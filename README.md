# Vulpes Engine
This is a graphics engine that I've been working on in my spare time. I have been using this project to learn more about graphics programming and how to structure large-scale programs.

This render features 3 dynamic spherical lights with physically based specular and diffuse BRDFs using the engine's deferred renderer. Both objects are normal mapped for higher visual quality.
