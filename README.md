# Vulpes Engine
This is a graphics engine that I've been working on in my spare time. I have been using this project to learn more about graphics programming and how to structure large-scale programs. 

## Sample Render

This render demonstrates metallic and dielectric objects with a roughness scale and image-based lighting. The top row is metallic and the bottom row dielectric, with the roughest spheres on the left side. The Utah Teapot is rendered below with dielectric (ceramic) and metal (iron) versions.
